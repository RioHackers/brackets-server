Brackets Server
===============

Brackets Server is a server for providing hosted version of the popular code editor [Brackets](http://brackets.io/). The code editor can be loaded directly in the web browser and it doesnâ€™t require additional installations or browser extensions. Brackets works just like the desktop version, except that all projects and files reside on the server instead of the local file system.

The server may be useful for remote development, real-time changes and testing, development form thin clients or devices such as tablets, or it could be used in conjunction with other web applications for collaboration.

To check the current verion of Brackets source used in the server, please see [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/rabchev/brackets-server/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

Installation
------------

Install from npm:

    $ npm install brackets -g

Usage Examples
--------------

    $ brackets --port 80 --proj-dir /var/projects --supp-dir /var/brackets

**IMPORTANT:** Make sure ***projects*** directory exists.

**IMPORTANT:** Brackets Server cannot work simultaneously on the same machine with the desktop Brackets because of 
port conflict in one of the build-in modules. The error thrown is: "Error: listen EADDRINUSE". 
To workaround this problem if you ever need to use bouth simultaneously, run Brackets Server in Docker container.

All arguments are optional.

| Short Option | Long Option      | Default Value     | Description
|--------------|------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------
| `-p <prot>`  | `--port`         | `6800`            | TCP port on which Brackets server is listening.
| `-j <dir>`   | `--proj-dir`     | `~/Projects`      | Root directory for projects. Directories above this root cannot be accessed.
| `-s <dir>`   | `--supp-dir`     | `~/.brackets-srv` | Root directory for Brackets supporting files such as user extensions, configurations and state persistence.
| `-d`         | `--user-domains` | `false`           | Allows Node domains to be loaded from user extensions.

**NOTE:** Some Brackets extensions require external Node.js process, called node domain. Node domains run on the server, thereby allowing arbitrary code to be executed on the server through custom extensions.  Since this imposes very serious security and stability risks, Brackets Server will not load nor execute domains from user extensions, unless `-d` option is specified.

Embedding Brackets Server in Web Applications
---------------------------------------------

Example with Express:

```javascript
    var path        = require("path"),
        http        = require("http"),
        express     = require("express"),
        brackets    = require("brackets"),
        app         = express(),
        server      = http.createServer(app);

    app.get("/", function (req, res) {
        res.send("Hello World");
    });

    var bracketsOpts = {
        projectsDir: path.join(__dirname, ".."),
        supportDir: path.join(__dirname, "..", "/support")
    };
    brackets(server, bracketsOpts);

    server.listen(3000);

    console.log("Your application is availble at http://localhost:3000");
    console.log("You can access Brackets on http://localhost:3000/brackets/");
```

**NOTE:** The default values for `projectsDir` and `supportDir` are different when Brackets Server is initiated from code. They are respectively `./projects` and `./brackets`, relative to the current working directory.

Options:

| Option           | Default Value     | Description
|------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------
| httpRoot         | `/brackets`       | Defines the root HTTP endpoint for Brackets Server (http://yourdomain.com/brackets).
| projectsDir      | `./projects`      | Root directory for projects. Directories above this root cannot be accessed.
| supportDir       | `./brackets`      | Root directory for Brackets supporting files such as user extensions, configurations and state persistence.
| allowUserDomains | `false`           | Allows Node domains to be loaded from user extensions.


Development & Testing
------------
1. From the project root, run `git submodule update --init`.
2. `cd brackets-src`
3. `npm install` from within brackets-src dir
4. `grunt` from within brackets-src dir again. <br> 
    Rerun everytime you do any work or update brackets source code.
5. `cd ../` back out to project root
6. `npm install`
7. `grunt build`<br> 
    Rerun everytime you do any work or update brackets source code.
8. `grunt publish:simulate` to reinstall as `brackets` npm module.
9. Run command above `brackets --port 80 --proj-dir /var/projects --supp-dir /var/brackets` to start the brackets server
10. Go to http://localhost:80/ in your browser (or on whichever port specified in previous command)

Grunt Tasks
------------
All command run from root of project, `grunt <task>`

| Task             | Description
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------
| build            | Main task which outputs brackets server dist.
| docs             | Generate jsDoc from code.
| publish:simulate | Install npm package globally as `brackets`.
| build-config     | Generate a new configuration file shown in Help->About menu.


Updating Brackets: (Often does not work without fixes)
------------
1. `cd brackets-src`
2. `git pull origin <brackets sha5 for desired release>` <br>
    for example: `git pull origin cf9cf46984290a7bdcd21e6b222c1040042d4d79`
3. `git submodule update --init`
4. From project root, regenerate config: `grunt build-config`
